        <p>In 2011-2012, the Los Angeles Food Policy Council developed the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP), an innovative local food procurement policy aimed at building markets for good food to create an equitable food system for all of Los Angeles. Developed through a participatory process that engaged over 100 stakeholders and procurement experts, GFPP commits major government institutions to a set of purchasing guidelines that are unique in their equal emphasis on five food system values. The program progressively certifies participants—meaning that large food purchasers, such as schools and municipal governments receive higher rankings for food purchases that meet tiered, values-driven standards. These standards, which include impacts on local economies, environmental sustainability, food chain workers, animal welfare, and the nutritional content of food served, represent the core tenets of the “Good Food” that GFPP aims to bring to communities served by these institutions. By harnessing public institutions’ buying power, the policy has already led to tremendous shifts in local purchasing and spurred health and economic benefits to students, food suppliers, growers, entrepreneurs, and distributors alike.

  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Our project aims to identify the causal relations between the implementation of this program and local socio-economic development by applying a Difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis. As GFPP has been marked as a priority in several other cities, including Austin, Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland and Twin Cities, and there lack quantitative evaluation of the program, our project can serve as a reference for these other cities in the potential outcomes of GFPP.
    </p>
    <p>Since Los Angeles is the very first city piloting the program, we mark LA as our "city of interest". Given the fact that GFPP is mainly adopted by LA Unified School District (LAUSD), other schools outside of LAUSD (but still in LA county) are therefore ideal as a control group in our analysis. We utilize school-level data from <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/">California Department of Education</a> and focus on the change of students' physical performance (measured by <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/pf/">physical fitness test</a> records) before and after the implementation of GFPP between schools in LAUSD and other schools outside of LAUSD.
