  <h2>Program Introduction</h2>
  
  <h3>Good Food Purchasing Program in LA</h3>
    <p>In 2011-2012, the Los Angeles Food Policy Council developed the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP), an innovative local food procurement policy aimed at building markets for good food to create an equitable food system for all of Los Angeles. Developed through a participatory process that engaged over 100 stakeholders and procurement experts, GFPP commits major government institutions to a set of purchasing guidelines that are unique in their equal emphasis on five food system values. The program progressively certifies participants—meaning that large food purchasers, such as schools and municipal governments receive higher rankings for food purchases that meet tiered, values-driven standards. These standards, which include impacts on local economies, environmental sustainability, food chain workers, animal welfare, and the nutritional content of food served, represent the core tenets of the “Good Food” that GFPP aims to bring to communities served by these institutions. By harnessing public institutions’ buying power, the policy has already led to tremendous shifts in local purchasing and spurred health and economic benefits to students, food suppliers, growers, entrepreneurs, and distributors alike.

  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Our project aims to identify the causal relations between the implementation of this program and local socio-economic development by applying a Difference-in-difference analysis. Since Los Angeles is the very first city piloting the program, we mark LA as our "city of interest". Given that LA adopted the policy from 2012, our timeframe and sample size are limited, we will also include San Francisco -- the second city adopting the policy -- into our sample.
    </p>
    <p>The City of Chicago has just adopted GFPP in this Octorber. Therefore, we will also try to further utilize our regression results to induce the implications of adopting GFPP to the socio-economic development of Chicago.
