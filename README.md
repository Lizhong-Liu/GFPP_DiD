Group Member: Manyi Wang (12144482), Yiran Hao (12149086), Lizhong Liu (12144561)


#### Project Overview
We will develop an interactive website for the homeless and organizations (name) building temporary shelters for the homeless by mapping current shelters and potential locations for new shelters. We will use open data of Chicago and pilot in Chicago. Once the feasibility proves out, we will promote the projects to major cities including New York City, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and San Francisco etc. 


#### Policy Interest: Urban Planning, Social Work and Public Administration
1. Provide reference for the government and nonprofits to help the homeless;
2. Inform the public of locations where the homeless gather and loiter (might also be the places potentially more dangerous i.e. higher     crime rates etc.)
3. Better utilize public resources -- why donâ€™t the homeless like staying at the shelters? (need rephrase)
