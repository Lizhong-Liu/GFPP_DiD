# Transit2Home
## PPHA 30550/1 - Final Project
**Group Member: [Manyi Wang](@manyiw), [Yiran Hao](@chiertu), [Lizhong Liu](@Lizhong-Liu)**


#### Project Overview
We will develop an interactive website for the homeless and organizations (e.g. [Cardborigami](http://www.cardborigami.org)) building temporary shelters for the homeless by mapping current shelters and potential locations for new shelters. We will use open data of Chicago and pilot in Chicago. Once the feasibility proves out, we will promote the projects to major cities including New York City, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and San Francisco etc. 


#### Policy Interest: Urban Planning, Social Work and Public Administration
- Provide reference for the government and nonprofits to help the homeless;
- Inform the public of locations where the homeless gather and loiter (might also be the places potentially more dangerous i.e. higher crime rates etc.)
- Better utilize public resources -- why don’t the homeless like staying at the shelters? (need rephrase)


#### Data Source
- Chicago Data Portal
  - Neighborhoods / Chicago Community Areas
  - Demographical Data: a) Ethinics; b) Population density
  - Socio-Economic Data: a) Income/GDP per capita; b) Level of education; c) [Crime rates](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)
  - Open Space Data: a) [Gardens](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Open-Spaces-Neighbor-Space-Gardens-KML/mxm5-4jmw); b) [River Walk](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Open-Spaces-Riverwalk-KML/22bv-uv6r)

- Current Homeless Shelter Locations
  - Proximity to homeless care offering organization

- Other Target Cities (To include after the pilot succeed.)
  - [Los Angeles Data Portal](https://www.lacity.org/search/google/GIS)
  - New York City Data Portal
  - Washington D.C. Data Portal
  
  
#### Functionality of Transit2Home
- Exhibit the correlations between environmental resources and socioeconomic resources
- Exhibit locations where the homeless gather and loiter
- Mapping these locations suitable for the construction of temporary shelters
- Suggesting locations that are both suitable and lawful to build temporary locations
  
  
#### Visualization of Transit2Home
  We are going to develop an interactive website on which we intend to include (and potentially not limit to) the following:
- Neighborhoods and/or communities (boundaries); Demographical characteristics
- Open space: green space, parks, public recreational areas, rivers
- Economic development status: income level, GDP per capita
- Pins of the current available homeless shelters
- Pins of potential locations for the homeless
  
  
#### Potential Client
- Government
- Organizations with missions related to helping the homeless or building temporary shelters
- Researchers
- Other concerned parties
