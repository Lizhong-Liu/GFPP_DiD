  <h2>Regression Results</h2>

    <h3>Choice of dependent variable</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to measure GFPP's impact on student physical fitness.
      Among all the 6 stduent fitness areas (table 1) monitored by California state,
      we are most interested in students' finess change in Body Composition.
      This is because better food quality and a more balanced diet brought by
      GFPP do not necessarily tranaslate directly to improved body functions
      such as adrobic capacity, or improved athletic abilities such as muscle strength.
      However, we believe changes in students' body composition, such as
      lower fat percentadge expressed in skinfold measurement or BMI (Body Mass Index),
      response faster to a diet improvement. Therefore, we expect to see a higher
      fraction of students meeting the healthy body composition standand a few years
      after the policy was implemented.</p>

    <h3>Difference in difference methodology</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to measure change in physically healthy student fraction caused by
      GFPP. However, change in body composition, as well as in a school's
      physically-healthy student fraction, has a lot of attributable factors other than
      the implementation of GFPP. For example, the overall trend towards healthy eating
      might have an effect on students' food choice when they eat outside of schools,
      and in turn leads to a change in students' body composition. Also, a change in
      school curriculum initiated by educational authorities might influence the sports time
      of every student in the state of California, and thus have an effect on
      schools' physically-healthy student fraction. All these factors can mess up our estimation
      of GFPP on schools' physically-healthy student fraction. However, as these factors are
      common trend that apply for all schools in LA county, we can estimate their
      aggregated effect using DiD model.
    </p>
    <p> Since GFPP is only adopted by the Unified School Districts of LA and not in
      other school districts. We used schools in unified school districts as treatment
      group and schools in other districts as controlled group. We measure the average physically-healthy
      students fraction within treatment group and control group. Then we subtract
      the change in treatment group with the change in control group to get a clean
      effect of GFPP on physically-healthy student fraction.
    </p>
    <h3>Control for covariates</h3>
    <p> We are aware that socioeconomic attributes of school influence
      the number of physically-healthy students in the school. Especially, our
      control and treatment group might not be randomly constructed and that
      they are not comparable across sosioeconomic attibutes such as schools' size,
      poverty level, ethnicity diversity, and gender diversity. That being considered,
      we performed a balance test between treatment group and control group from
      the following four dimentions.
     <table>
      <tr><th>List of covariates</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Number of enrollment</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Fraction of students enrolled in Free and Reduced Price Meals Program</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Fraction of female students</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Fraction of white students</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>
      <tr><td><img width=50% src="plots/baseline_table1.png"></img></td> <td><img width=50% src="plots/baseline_table_2.png"></img></td></tr>
    <h3>Robust test: Fixed effect</h3>
    <p> We are also aware that besides the coraviates we have controlled for,
      school may have other indiviaully-invariant attributes that we haven't accounted for.
      For example, schools have different sports facilities, differnet locations that
      provide access to different environments. These may also influence students
      physical fitness level.
