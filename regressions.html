  <h2>Regression Results</h2>

    <h3>Dependent Variable</h3>
    <p>
      GFPP claims to have positive impacts on local economies, environmental sustainability,
      food chain workers, animal welfare, and the nutritional content of food served. Ideally,
      we would like to test the impact of GFPP in all these five areas. However, the availability
      of data only allow us to test whether the population's physical fitness benefit from the
      nutritional standard set by GFPP. We do have county level data of food business sale volumn
      and labour force, but since LA is the only county that has adopted GFPP, we do not
      have enough sample to construct a treatment group, not to mention that we'll need a large sample to study
      the spillover effect of shifting food purchase towards local farmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adoption of GFPP by the LA Unified School Districts provides us with a chance to
      study GFPP's impact on studnets' phsical fitness.
      Among all the 6 stduent fitness areas (table 1) monitored by California state,
      we are most interested in students' finess change in Body Composition.
      This is because better food quality and a more balanced diet brought by
      GFPP do not necessarily tranaslate to improved body functions
      such as higher adrobic capacity, or improved athletic abilities such as
      stronger abdominal and back muscel.
      However, we believe students' body composition, such as fat percentadge
      expressed in skinfold measurement or BMI (Body Mass Index), do responde and
      responde faster to a diet improvement. Therefore, we expect to see a higher
      fraction of students meeting the healthy body composition standand a few years
      after the policy was implemented.</p>

      <p> Pysical Fitness Test (PFT) is conducted in every LA school yearly on grade 5,7 and 9,
        giveing us a good panal data of students' fitness test result. However, complexity lies in
        that <a href= 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/pf/healthfitzones.asp'>test standards</a> were adjusted
        in year 2006 and 2011. We plotted the testing result to double check whether the change
        of test standards has caused significant disruptance in testing score. </p>

      <p>As seen from the plots above, the test standards change in 2011 does cause
        some fitness measurement to plunge. Due to lack of expertise in
        realigning physical test scores, we choose to drop historic data until year 2010.
        In the second column of Table 3 is the trend of fitness test score from year 2011 to 2015.
       </p>

    <h3>Difference in Difference Methodology</h3>
    <p>Given that change in body composition, as well as in a school's
      physically-healthy student fraction, has a lot of attributable factors other than
      the implementation of GFPP. For example, the overall trend towards healthy eating
      might have an effect on students' food choice when they eat outside of schools,
      and in turn leads to a change in students' body composition. Also, a change in
      school curriculum initiated by educational authorities might influence the sports time
      of every student in the state of California, and thus have an effect on
      schools' physically-healthy student fraction. All these factors can mess up our estimation
      of GFPP on schools' physically-healthy student fraction. However, as these factors are
      common trend that apply for all schools in LA county, we can estimate their
      aggregated effect by using DiD model.
    </p>
    <p> Since GFPP is only adopted by the Unified School Districts of LA and not in
      other school districts. We then construct a treatment group with schools in unified school districts
      and and a control group with schools in other districts. We measure the average physically-healthy
      students fraction within treatment group and control group. Then we subtract
      the change in treatment group with the change in control group to get a clean
      effect of GFPP on physically-healthy student fraction.
    </p>

    <h3>Baseline Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Before running the regression, we would like to compare the treatment group with the controll group to make sure that they are comparable
      in all other dimensions besides getting the treatment (i.e. GFPP) or not. Namely, we compare the means of covariates
      used in our regressions between the treatment and the control group. In the following, we list the
      covariates we use, and apply the baseline analysis.

      <h3>Robust test: Fixed effect</h3>
    <p> Besides the coraviates we have controlled for,
      school may have other indiviaully-invariant attributes that we haven't accounted for.
      For example, schools have different sports facilities, differnet locations that
      provide access to different environments. These may also influence students
      physical fitness level.
